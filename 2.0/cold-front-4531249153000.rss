        <title>Cold Front</title>
        <link>https://www.dr.dk/lyd/p1/cold-front-4531249153000</link>
        <description>On a November day in 2022, Danish journalist Niels finds himself in a small rubber boat out at sea between Denmark and Sweden. He is chasing a potential Russian spy ship. Upon locating it, he spots a crew member with an assault rifle around his neck, staring directly at him.
This hunt for the potential spy ship is part of a yearlong investigation. Since Russia's full scale invastion of Ukraine, a group of Nordic journalists have been digging ever deeper into a murky world of Russian spying, seabed warfare and disinformation.
This podcast series will end up revealing evidence of what experts call a complex hybrid war, which is already playing out in the Nordic countries and in the waters surrounding them.

The story was researched together with Niels Fastrup, Lisbeth Quass, Inghild Eriksen, Håvard Gulldahl, Maria Georgieva and Ali Fegan.

Music, sound design and mixing by Mikkel Rønnau and Marie Kildebæk.
Editorial assistant Anna Brage Stevens.
Senior producer and editor Jens Vithner.
